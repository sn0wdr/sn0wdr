# About Me
👋 I'm a 22-year-old BS Psychology student, and I'm incredibly passionate about programming.

💻 Programming isn't just a hobby for me; it's a source of boundless fascination and creativity. I find joy in crafting elegant solutions to complex problems through code.

🩺 While I'm currently pursuing my BS in Psychology, my aspirations stretch beyond those horizons. I'm on a determined path to becoming a Medical Doctor (MD) in the near future.

🌱 My enthusiasm for learning knows no bounds. I'm constantly seeking new knowledge and skills, both in psychology and programming, with an eagerness to share what I learn along the way.

🚀 On GitHub, you'll find my projects and contributions, which reflect my dedication to these diverse interests. I believe that the synergy between psychology, programming, and medicine holds immense potential for innovation and positive impact.
